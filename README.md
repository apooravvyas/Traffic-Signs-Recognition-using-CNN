In this Deep Learning project, we have built a model for the classification of traffic signs available in the image into many categories using a convolutional neural network(CNN) and Keras library.

The image dataset is consists of more than 50,000 pictures of various traffic signs(speed limit, crossing, traffic signals, etc.) Around 43 different classes are present in the dataset for image classification. The dataset classes vary in size like some class has very few images while others have a vast number of images. The dataset doesnâ€™t take much time and space to download as the file size is around 314.36 MB. It contains two separate folders, train and test, where the train folder is consists of classes, and every category contains various images.

We need to follow the below 4 steps to build our traffic sign classification model:

Dataset exploration
CNN model building
Model training and validation
Model testing
